theres a node when you have a string and you move it (when attached at the end)


a node is where the string doesnt move at all


eg:

where the wave's amplitude is the smallest is where a node is.

one wave from one direction and one from the other and when they meet they destructively interfere and thus cancel eachother out and decrease in amplitude
