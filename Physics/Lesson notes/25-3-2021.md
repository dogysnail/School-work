superposition is how qwaves can eithe rget bigger or smaller

eg:

Noise canceling headphones where it uses this method to cancle out the noise





#### Wave interferance

when 2 different wave sources get closer, then the waves get pushed and thus cancel eachother out (this is how noise cancelation works).

[Wave interference sim](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/wave-interference/latest/wave-interference_en.html)





## Lab for today:

### We are going to be making a tone and then creating another one and then canceling the noise


eg: 

one tone generator at 500Hz and another one at 500Hz and thus it will cause your ears to hear a louder and softer noise when you walk parralel to the device creating the noise. this is because of the prinicipal above (see simulation)


here only the amplitude of the wave change





there is constructive interference where the amplitude will increase since they are the exact same but otherwise they will cancel eachother out 


theres a node when you have a string and you move it (when attached at the end)


a node is where the string doesnt move at all


eg:

where the wave's amplitude is the smallest is where a node is.

one wave from one direction and one from the other and when they meet they destructively interfere and thus cancel eachother out and decrease in amplitude


when you blox accross the top of a tube (blowing across a wine bottle) its a node too. it sends a wave down which comes back up again which means they interfere (see reason why above). the note you get is dependent on the lenght so if you add water, then the length decreases and the tone pitch increases
