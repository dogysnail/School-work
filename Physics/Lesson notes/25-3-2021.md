superposition is how qwaves can eithe rget bigger or smaller

eg:

Noise canceling headphones where it uses this method to cancle out the noise





#### Wave interferance

when 2 different wave sources get closer, then the waves get pushed and thus cancel eachother out (this is how noise cancelation works).

[Wave interference sim](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/wave-interference/latest/wave-interference_en.html)





## Lab for today:

### We are going to be making a tone and then creating another one and then canceling the noise


eg: 

one tone generator at 500Hz and another one at 500Hz and thus it will cause your ears to hear a louder and softer noise when you walk parralel to the device creating the noise. this is because of the prinicipal above (see simulation)


here only the amplitude of the wave change





there is constructive interference where the amplitude will increase since they are the exact same but otherwise they will cancel eachother out
