# Research Questions


#### Research Question ####
1. how big of a threat is climate change
2. What are we doing to stop climate change and how effective is it
3. What are the future effects of climate change at the current rate
4. How many deaths / extintions will be caused by climate change at its current rate
5. what will it cost to stop climate change outright


#### Why will they be usefull ####

1. The first research question could be usefull since it is very important to realize the threat of something before deciding if its wort tackeling. an example of this process was the cutting down of the amazon rainforest. we found out that the threat was that if we keep cutting down trees, animals will go extinct and we will lose alot of oxygen. 
2. This research is also usefull since we need to know how we can stop climate change. by knowing what methods are working and which methods arent,  we can construct a plan on how to solve climate change
3. Future effects of climate change are important since it can be used to inspire people into helping to solve climate change.
4. this is good for the same reason as research question number 3
5. this is important so we know how much we will need to prepare and how much we can expect to spend on clumate change



#### Where will i get information / recources ####

1. Online (Scholarly Articles and news websites)
2. Online and in real life(Scholarly articles, news websites,  blogs and visting areas to see what they are doing to stop climate change)
3. Online and in real life (Scholarly articles, news website and )
